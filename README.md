# Python_Detection_Man_in_the_Middle
This program analyzes the private network and evaluates whether the MAC address of the router or other devices
    in the network has changed. If there are two or more identical IP addresses in the network with the same MAC
    address, the user is notified with the option to terminate data transfer to and from the network.
    The program runs both in Windows and in Linux
